# Employee Management System

A simple and intuitive Employee Management System built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** using **Context Api** for state managment. This application allows for admin and employee logins, user creation, and task management. It is currently designed to use `localStorage` for data storage, with future plans to integrate **MongoDB** for enhanced functionality.
